* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.

- Started of by creating a variable that targets the start button from the html file;
- Then called that variable to assign to it the an event listener so that when the start    button is clicked it will start the game.
A start game variable will be created which have functions that will start the game, time and load up the questions 

* For the questions, I will start off my taging the questions id from the document. This will be use from moving the hide clase to visible. 
    - from there I will target the questions-title tags and apprenchild on there for the questions.







    //My plan is to create the questions on the question title tags 
       - then create the choices on the choices tag
       - from there do a if statement that tag the questions to the choices. for example, rightanswer = question 1 = choce 1, else rightanswer = wrong answer. return wrong answer.
