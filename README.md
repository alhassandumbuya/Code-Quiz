# Module 6 Challenge Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Your Task
This week, I will build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 


## Acceptance Criteria

Create a code quiz that contains the following requirements:

* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
 
  * Questions contain buttons for each answer.
  * 
  * When answer is clicked, the next question appears
  * 
  * If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock

* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

  * When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score
  
## Mock-Up

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
